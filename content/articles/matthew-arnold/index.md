Authors and poets look to the past and present for inspiration, whether that is a far place long ago or in the moment. Their environment helps to shape the author’s decisions regarding their poetry’s subjects and styles. Matthew Arnold’s early education and surroundings strongly influenced his writing throughout his life, both in poetry and in prose. In religion, in culture, and in classical works, Arnold became an influential intellectual praised to this day, while managing to become a respected poet in his own right at the same time.

Matthew Arnold was born on <time datetime="1822-12-24">December 24, 1822</time>, in Laleham, Middlesex, in the United Kingdom. Thomas Arnold, his father, became one of the most well-respected educators of the time as the famous headmaster of Rugby School. Matthew Arnold would be influenced deeply by his father’s work, studying at Rugby for some time, until he was provided a scholarship from Oxford University in which he attended. He married Frances Lucy in <time datetime="1851">1851</time>, and by <time datetime="1857">1857</time> at the young age of thirty-four, he was the Oxford Professor of Poetry after working as a secretary for Lord Lansdowne, a politician and one of Her Majesty’s Inspectors of Schools. During this time, he drafted many poems, most of them in collections. At Oxford, he produced two major lectures: <i>On the Modern Element in Literature</i> in <time datetime="1857">1857</time> (famously presented in the English vernacular, not Latin), and <i>On Translating Homer</i> in 1860-61. This would truly begin Arnold’s history as a sage writer, in poetry and prose. After retiring in 1886 from school inspection, he would die in <time datetime="1888">1888</time> of heart failure after running to meet the train.

Arnold was a poet of the Victorian era: the period of the reign of Queen Victoria from <time datetime="1837-06-20">June 20, 1837</time>, until her death on <time datetime="1901-01-22">January 22, 1901</time>. George P. Landow characterizes Matthew Arnold as a “sage writer”—a type of writer who instructs the reader on social issues. “Sage writing” was popular during the Victorian era, but Arnold was one of the most respected and famous of all through his work <i>Culture and Anarchy</i>.

Thomas Arnold deeply influenced his son, especially in religion. Thomas Arnold was a champion of the idea of a rounded individual, but he also provided his incredibly liberal view of religion, a view that his son Matthew would consume for his entire life. He had no interest in the supernatural part of religion, instead preferring the poetic, literary element. Many prose works near the end of his life followed this topic. In <i>Literature and Dogma</i>, he states that <q>The word ‘God’ is used in most cases as by no means a term of science or exact knowledge, but a term of poetry and eloquence, a real term thrown out, so to speak, as a not fully grasped object of the speaker’s consciousness—a literary term, in short;</q> and in the preface to <i>God and the Bible</i> with regard to the resurrection of Christ, <q>Never let us deny to this story power and pathos, or treat with hostility ideas which have entered so deep into the life of Christendom. But the story is not true; it never really happened.</q> Arnold’s poetic works would also commonly focus on a religious subject, including his most famous, “Dover Beach”. Written on his honeymoon at the Strait of Dover, “Dover Beach” is a poem that describes the loss of faith and the transition away from religion in the Victorian Era, metaphorically shown with imagery of the sea and France in the distance:

<blockquote cite="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_poetical_works_of_Matthew_Arnold/Dover_Beach" style="text-align: center;">

The Sea of Faith  
Was once, too, at the full, and round earth’s shore  
Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furl’d.  
But now I only hear  
Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,  
Retreating, to the breath  
Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear  
And naked shingles of the world

</blockquote>

This is in response to the challenges of Charles Darwin and Thomas Henry Huxley, as well as other intellectuals, challenging the church system and its strong ideas. The literary influence of Arnold’s “Dover Beach” continues to this day in books, poems, and court cases.

The factual love that Arnold had for classical works, especially the poems of Homer, is obvious in both styles of his work. <i>On Translating Homer</i> and <i>On Translating Homer: Last Words</i> shows literary criticism. The focus of these poemsis to critique translations of Homer’s epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey, and justly identify their strengths and weaknesses. The primary conflict is one of doctrine; to translate more literally or stylistically. As Arnold himself puts it, <q>Probably both sides would agree that the translator’s ‘first duty is to be faithful;’ but the real question at issue between them is, in what faithfulness consists.</q> He brought multiple modern translations to scrutiny and laid out a blueprint of his ideal version: Arnold primary advocates for the usage of hexameterin translations, as well as projecting a ‘grand style,’ but were never popular views on the subject. Arnold also authored a poem on the <i>Iliad</i>, “Palladium”, based off the legendary object of the same name said to have protected Troy from the Achaeans. It elegantly describes the legend, describing the conflict with vivid imagery of serene mountains and bloody battles in Troy below, who is destined to die either way: as Arnold expresses <q>And when it fails, fight as we will, we die; And while it lasts, we cannot wholly end.</q>

Matthew Arnold wrote about the current state of society often as a sage writer, especially in regard to culture in modern life. In <i>Culture and Anarchy</i>, as he explains, <q>The whole scope of the essay is to recommend culture as the great help out of our present difficulties; this culture being a pursuit of our total perfection by means of getting to know, on all the matters which most concern us, the best which has been thought and said in the world.</q> Arnold would coin the word ‘philistine’ in the work to describe people who undervalue culture and preach the need for a true cultured society. He also is credited for coining ‘new journalism’ as well in reference to W. T. Stead of The Pall Mall Gazette.Arnold expresses, <q>We have had opportunities of observing a new journalism which a clever and energetic man has lately invented. It has much to recommend it; it is full of ability, novelty, variety, sensation, sympathy, generous instincts; its one great fault is that it is feather-brained. It throws out assertions at a venture because it wishes them true.</q> This statement would become increasingly popular as the twentieth century approached.

Matthew Arnold’s surroundings and early education strongly influenced his writings throughout his life. Using religion, culture, and classical works, Arnold became an influential intellectual praised to this day, while managing to become a respected poet in his own right at the same time.Astonishingly the Victorian era did notrecognize Arnold’s true contribution to his lifetime. His works did not have the flare or ease of Stead’s journalism for the Victorian philistines, but even for today’s poetic audience, intellectuals still discuss and analyze his work and ideas. Clearly, Matthew Arnold influences his audience today in the way he always wanted: to create critical minds like his very own.
