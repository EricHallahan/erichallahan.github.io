### Academics

I attended [Downingtown High School West Campus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downingtown_High_School) from <time datetime="2015-09">September 2015</time> through <time datetime="2019-06">June 2019</time>, at which time I graduated sixth in my class (of 384) with a weighted <abbr title="Grade Point Average">GPA</abbr> of 4.4. During that time, I received a [Bausch + Lomb Honorary Science Award](https://admissions.rochester.edu/high-school-awards/) for scientific achievement as a junior and was listed on the distinguished honor roll for all four years I attended.

After high school, I selected to enter undergraduate study at the Pennsylvania State University in pursuit of a [Bachlor of Science in (General) Engineering](https://bulletins.psu.edu/undergraduate/colleges/engineering/engineering-bs/) as a part of their (small) [Multidisciplinary Engineering Design](https://www.brandywine.psu.edu/academics/bachelors-degrees/engineering) program, which is offered through [Brandywine](https://www.brandywine.psu.edu/) with additional support from [Great Valley](https://greatvalley.psu.edu/). I was a student of the program until unfortunately needing to voluntarily leave the university due to various personal circumstances in <time time="2023-04-06">April 2023</time>.

### Experience

<section>

#### Competition Robotics

I participated in the VEX Robotics Competition as a member of the infamous [VEXMEN](https://www.vexmen.com/) of [Brandywine Robotics](https://brandywinerobotics.org/) throughout my secondary schooling, first as a part of Team <samp>80P</samp> <i>VEXMEN: Pyro</i> for the 2012–2013 season ([Sack Attack](https://vrc-kb.recf.org/hc/en-us/articles/9661809013015-VRC-History-2012-2013-Sack-Attack)), and after the team was split in two, as a part of Team <samp>80Y</samp> <i>VEXMEN: Cypher</i> for the 2013–2014 ([Toss Up](https://vrc-kb.recf.org/hc/en-us/articles/9661569769111-VRC-History-2013-2014-Toss-Up)) and 2014–2015 ([Skyrise](https://vrc-kb.recf.org/hc/en-us/articles/9661504917911-VRC-History-2014-2015-Skyrise)) seasons. <i>VEXMEN: Cypher</i> transitioned into high school with a number change to <samp>81Y</samp> for the 2015–2016 season ([Nothing But Net](https://vrc-kb.recf.org/hc/en-us/articles/9661371440151-VRC-History-2015-2016-Nothing-But-Net)), and would continue participating that way for the 2016-2017 ([Starstruck](https://vrc-kb.recf.org/hc/en-us/articles/9661321161879-VRC-History-2016-2017-Starstruck)), 2017–2018 ([In The Zone](https://vrc-kb.recf.org/hc/en-us/articles/9661170051351-VRC-History-2017-2018-In-the-Zone)), and 2018–2019 ([Turning Point](https://vrc-kb.recf.org/hc/en-us/articles/9661009797527-VRC-History-2018-2019-Turning-Point)) seasons, after which the team aged-out of competition.

Teams <samp>80Y</samp> and <samp>81Y</samp> <i>VEXMEN: Cypher</i> were highly successful. <samp>80Y</samp> attended the 2015 VEX Robotics World Championship, and through a combination of luck, skill, and smooth-talking, managed to find itself a Middle School Tournament Finalist (and nearly winning the prestigious Excellence Award). After a gap of a year, <samp>81Y</samp> qualified and returned to the VEX Robotics World Championship in 2017 by winning the High School Excellence Award at the Pennsylvania State Championship, of which it would return with an Engineering Award. <samp>81Y</samp> attended the VEX Robotics World Championship for the last time in 2018 by qualifying as a Tournament Finalist of the Pennsylvania State Championship, and represented the team's most successful run: As the only team in the tournament to win every autonomous period it participated in, through shear consistency it defeated the top-ranked seed in Research division to become a Division Champion and High School Tournament Finalist.

My primary role with <i>VEXMEN: Cypher</i> throughout its lifetime was, [perhaps fittingly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypher_(Marvel_Comics)), being the team's dedicated programmer. The experience accumulated established a strong background in embedded programming, system design & integration, and controls.

#### Lockheed Martin Learning for Life Aviation

Hosted by volunteers of both former and then-current employees of the Sikorsky Coatesville plant, this program involved a variety of educational activities related to the field of aviation. The program's primary focus, however, was restoring a RotoWay Scorpion Too acquired by the American Helicopter Museum of West Chester, Pennsylvania, to displayable condition. After (many, many) hours of labor, the (now blue) Scorpion Too restored by the program is now [on display at the American Helicopter Museum, paired alongside a Model 133](https://americanhelicopter.museum/aircraft/rotorway-scorpions/).

#### EleutherAI

I stumbled into joining EleutherAI as a contributor in <time datetime="2021-02"> February 2021</time>, and would later become a core member by <time datetime="2021-03">late March 2021</time>. During my time volunteering, I would become maintainer and webmaster of the EleutherAI website and blog, redevelop its logo, and (most significantly) assist in the creation of [GPT-NeoX-20B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06745). After two years of dedicated contributorship, various personal circumstances made my volunteering unsustainable and forced me to depart against my desire in <time time="2023-03-15">March 2023</time>.

## About this site

This site is one I have constructed myself to be my personal public portfolio and blog. There is no particular focus, other than it is all content I would like to make accessible beyond myself and share with others—expect articles of varying types covering a range of topics and experiences, most often of primarily technical or academic nature written to an audience I feel will best benefit from the communication of the content.

This site is statically generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and strives to be as accessible to navigate and consume as possible across screen sizes and device types. As it is still early in development, site organization is not yet concrete; at this point in time, articles are living documents and I may change site content as I see fit. Suggestions for improvement are welcome—readership should feel free to drop me a line if there is a change they believe can improve the user experience.
